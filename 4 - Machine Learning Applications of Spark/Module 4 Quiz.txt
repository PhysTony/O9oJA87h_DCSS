1. Machine learning is suited to solve which of the following tasks? (Select all that apply.)
A/B Testing
Machine learning optimizes between different versions of websites or emails.

Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing applies statistical methods to language.

Churn Analysis
Churn analysis predicts customer engagement.

Financial Forecasting
Time series analyses are commonly applied to financial data.

Image Recognition
Neural networks are effective for operating on image data.

Fraud Detection
Web traffic data can be used to predict fraudulent transaction.


2. Is a model that is 99% accurate at predicting breast cancer a good model?
Likely no because there are not many cases of cancer in a general population
There are many ways of quantifying the success of a classification task. Accuracy (which is
technically the true positive and true negative rates over the total observations) might not
capture false negatives.


3. What is an appropriate baseline model to compare a machine learning solution to?
The average of the dataset
Predicting the average is a good benchmark to try to improve upon using maching learning.


4. What is Machine Learning? (Select all that apply.)
A function that maps features to an output
Machine learning maps input features to an output.

Learning patterns in your data without being explicitly programmed
Machine learning uses linear algebra and calculus to learn patterns in data without being
explicitly programmed.


5. (Fill in the blanks with the appropriate answer below.)
Predicting whether a website user is fraudulent or not is an example of _________ machine
learning. It is a __________ task.
supervised, classification
In this case, whether the user is fraudulent is the dependent variable and we are classifying fraudulent from non-fraudulent users.


6. (Fill in the blanks with the appropriate answer below.)
Grouping similar users together based on past activity is an example of _________ machine
learning. It is a _________ task.
unsupervised, clustering
In this case, there is no clear dependent variable so it is an unsupervised problem involving clustering users.


7. Predicting the next quarter of a company's earnings is an example of...
Regression
The value we're predicting is a continuous, theoretically unbounded value.


8. Why do we want to perform a train/test split before we train a machine learning model? (Select
all that apply.)
To evaluate how our model performs on unseen data
We care about how the model performs on data it hasn't seen before.

To keep the model from "overfitting" where it memorizes the data it has seen
Overfitting is where a model does not generalize well to unseen data.


9. What is a linear regression model learning about your data?
The formula for the line of best fit
Linear regression learns the coefficients (or formula) of best line through the data.


10. How do you define a custom function not already part of core Spark?
With a User-Defined Function
A User-Defined Function (or UDF) allows you to extend core Spark.
